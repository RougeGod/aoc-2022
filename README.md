# aoc-2022
My first year trying Advent Of Code (25 stars in 2022 with 3 and counting in 2023)! Most code posted here is largely unchanged from when I first got the correct answer. Perhaps later I will format or rewrite. 

Most of the solutions are pretty janky and inefficient because I'm still learning Go/programming in general, and I haven't quite gotten the hang of how to properly use things like pointers and structs, nor do I have clever parsing solutions so I still have a lot of hard-coded inputs. 

Anyways, hopefully I can look back on this next year or beyond and see how far I have come since December 2022
